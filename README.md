Personal UI playground.

## Why: 
Sometimes I'm bored, and I see an interesting idea online and I think "ü§î Bet I could make that in Flutter"... so heres those files.

## What: 
This is the Raw Directory for the Project I use for this, Theres a central Main.dart that has whatever the currently being worked on Design. Old ones will be named based on the image source I used to build them.

## No seriously why: 
Practice, boredom, and making assets that I can reuse bits and pieces of in future Projects
